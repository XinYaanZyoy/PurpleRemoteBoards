## i wrote this software when i felt a need of online live remote board through which i could teach my sister physics and mathematics!!

this whole project is the result of that purpose, my coding passion and a week of coding nights!!

if you want to use this software it's free you can use this here [PurpleRemoteBoards](purpleremoteboards.firebaseapp.com)!!

if you want to use this source code either fork it download it! simple but kindly inform me before doing it!
i just want to know that person who is going to use my js poems!!
